    "content": "Facebook\nTwitter (X)\nInstagram\nSearch\nCall Us\nChat on WhatsApp\nFind Us on Maps\nAbout Us Mahayogi Gorakhnath, the Pravartak of the Nathpanth, holds a revered place in the saint tradition of India. In the spiritual tradition of India, the credit for spreading the knowledge of Kriya Yoga to the people goes to Mahayogi Guru Gorakhnath and the Nath Yogis. Considered a Yug-Pravartak saint, Mahayogi Gorakhnath was the forerunner of social change in India, offering a unique formula of health and worship alongside purification of the human body, mind, brain, and soul. The Nathpanth, promoted by Guru Shri Gorakhnath, guides Nishkam Karmayoga, viewing service dedicated to people’s welfare as a spiritual practice. Shri Gorakhnath Temple is the place of penance of Mahayogi Shri Gorakhnath Ji. It is widely believed that the Mahant of Shri Gorakhnath Temple and Shri Gorakshapeeth is the representative of Guru Shri Gorakhnath Ji. Since the time of this Yug-Pravartak Mahayogi, the temple’s philanthropic role has been expanding. In the modern era, Brahmaleen Mahant Digvijainath Ji Maharaj integrated education and medicine into this service. The establishment of Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad in 1932 marked the beginning of this ideological movement. Brahmaleen Mahant Digvijainath Ji Maharaj founded educational institutions from primary to higher education and paved the way for the establishment of Gorakhpur University. Continuing this legacy, Brahmaleen Mahant Avedyanath Ji Maharaj laid the foundation for significant contributions to allopathic medicine through the establishment of the Guru Shri Gorakshnath Chikitsalaya Samiti. The founding of Guru Shri Gorakshnath Chikitsalaya, following the Digvijainath Ayurvedic College and Digvijainath Ayurvedic Chikitsalaya, was a key milestone in healthcare service in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. Mahayogi Shri Gorakhnath’s legacy of social service and upliftment of the downtrodden continues to grow through the establishment of Mahayogi Gorakhnath University, Gorakhpur. This revolutionary academic endeavor merges yoga, Ayurveda, medical education, humanities, physical sciences, technical education, skill development, and vocational courses, aiming to revolutionize education and healthcare infrastructure in this historically underserved region. Vision and Aim of Mahayogi Gorakhnath University\nDevelop a world-class modern institution with state-of-the-art technology, facilities, and infrastructure, maintaining the highest standards in education across humanities, physical sciences, technology, medical fields, healthcare, agriculture, and skill development.\nEstablish institutions spanning all genres of medicine — from conventional to modern — engaged in research, development, technical education, and vocational skills, focused on local resources and needs.\nEncourage study and research in both ancient and modern streams of theoretical and practical knowledge related to education and health.\nBuild healthcare institutions and hospitals for allopathy, yoga, Ayurveda, etc., within a single campus, combining teaching, research, and affordable advanced healthcare services for the local community.\nPromote research, training, and propagation of modern medicine such as allopathy and its related streams.\nDevelop teaching, training, and research programs in nursing, pharmacy, paramedical, and other healthcare-related fields.\nImplement specialized curricula aimed at improving health services and employment opportunities for the local population.\nPrepare curricula related to highly specialized branches of medical studies and encourage further research and development in these areas.\nEstablish institutions connected to social welfare and health programs in remote rural areas of the region."

As the torchbearer of Dharma, he stood as the ultimate symbol of self-discipline, justice, and duty-bound leadership. His life is a guiding light for all who aspire to walk the path of truth and virtue. ‘Janani Janma Bhumishcha Swargadapi Gariyasi’ This ever-inspiring exclamation by Lord Sri Ram reflects his supreme devotion to his motherland and righteousness. He chose exile over throne, duty over comfort, and honor over convenience, setting an eternal example of what it means to lead with moral clarity and sacrifice. Lord Ram's reign — Ram Rajya — has become a benchmark for just governance, where truth, fairness, and compassion prevailed. He taught the world that power must always be guided by responsibility, and decisions must always align with Dharma. His life reminds us that strength is not in wealth or weapons, but in character, courage, and conviction. In a world where temptations often cloud judgment, Lord Ram's life urges us to rise above self-interest, uphold truth, and live with dignity, compassion, and responsibility. He is not just a historical figure; he is a timeless ideal — a living conscience for a society striving toward spiritual strength, unity, and ethical prosperity. Maharana Pratap Ji Maharana Pratap Ji was one of the unparalleled warriors of medieval Bharat. Veer Shiromani Maharana Pratap sacrificed everything for sovereignty, self-pride, religion, and motherland. ‘Jo hathi rakhe dharm ko tihi rakhe Kartar’ His ever-reverberating exclamation of valour inspires countless generations and guides the educational spirit of Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad. The Parishad ensures that youngsters studying in our institutions obtain up-to-date, systematic, and employment-oriented knowledge in their chosen disciplines — science, arts, and beyond. We use modern teaching aids and methods to make students self-reliant, employable, and confident individuals. At the same time, it is our mission to instill in them high moral and ethical values so they can serve society with integrity, dedication, and devotion."

A towering figure in India’s independence movement and a beacon of spiritual and educational leadership, he believed deeply in the power of youth to shape the future of the nation. To realize this vision, Poojya Maharaj Ji championed a Bharat-centric education system, one that was rooted in Indian values, heritage, and self-reliance. He established prototype institutions ranging from primary schools to higher education that served as models for what Indian education could truly become. Mahant Digvijainath Ji also played a pivotal role in the establishment of one of independent India’s earliest universities – Gorakhpur University (now Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gorakhpur University). Under his leadership, Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad grew into a 'Triveni' – a confluence of Education, Health, and Technology, serving society in a holistic, purpose-driven manner. Rashtra Sant Mahant Avedyanath Ji Maharaj The dynamic helmsman of Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad, Rashtra Sant Gorakshpeethadheeswar Brahmleen Mahant Avedyanath Ji Maharaj, expanded and institutionalized the dream initiated by his Gurudev. With unmatched devotion, he carried the torch of service and transformed it into a blazing Mahayajna of welfare, knowledge, and public good. Param Poojya Maharaj Ji established a wide network of institutions across Education, Training, Medicine, and Technology, reaching both rural and urban populations, especially in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. His philosophy of “सेवा से साधना” (Sadhna through Service) inspired the creation of schools, colleges, polytechnics, teacher training institutes, and nursing colleges. These institutions weren't merely centers of learning but temples of transformation, where minds were awakened and lives uplifted. His efforts also led to the establishment of Ayurvedic and Allopathic hospitals, catering to the health and wellness of the common people – further extending the vision of holistic national service. All these endeavors were deeply rooted in the noble vision of serving the nation through education, health, and cultural revival, reflecting the eternal values of selfless service and spiritual discipline."

Employment opportunities in this area are very few. Agriculture based industry is a matter of great concern. Therefore, to make agriculture an employable and viable option, this university should be running courses and doing relevant research to increase the production and the preservation and marketing of the local products to increase the income of farmers of the region which would result in mitigating and alleviating the myriad problems faced by them. Moreover to encourage and assist them by making available necessary expertise and know-how in setting up self-help cooperative groups, small scale industries and also promote awareness and provide technical skills to generate employment avenues in the region.\n9\nTo promote employment at the local level, the university shall create and run experimental programmes in this regard.

The institutions established and governed by Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad founded by Shri Gorakshpeeth should have unique and distinguished identity.\n2\n2. Vice Chancellor/head of institutions/principals/directors in-charges should present themselves as role models.\n3\n3. All the officers/members of the institutions should keep their institutions in their priorities, just as the way they think about themselves and continuously work for self-evolution and improvement, likewise they ought to have the same attitude and a sense of belongingness towards their institutions. The institution should become an integral part of their lives.\n4\n4. The modus operandi of the head of institutions should be transparent, unbiased and impartial.\n5\n5. Discipline is the backbone rather soul of any institution and is equally important and applicable right from the top to bottom line. Only a self-disciplined head of institution shall be able to pass on and inculcate the values of discipline and morality to the doctors, teachers, employees and administrative staff working with them. Therefore, a campus & work culture of self-discipline and morality needs to be developed, inculcated and incorporated in the day to day activities of the institutions.\n6\n6. Punctuality is the first and foremost condition in the observation of self-discipline. Hence, being on time at the institution and being available throughout working hours should be observed ritually and religiously in a disciplined manner.\n7\n7. Collectivism that comes from working with the team spirit in all the spheres of working should be developed in all our institutions.\n8\n8. At the beginning of each academic session, a detailed academic plan and calendar should be prepared and ought to be implemented and followed in letter and spirit throughout the session.\n9\n9. The anniversaries of great personalities and icons of various fields should be celebrated by organising cultural programmes, educating and enlightening students about their inspirational and motivational life story and their contribution towards the nation and society instead of declaring holiday.\n10\n10. On the eve of festive holidays, students should be made aware of the importance of celebrating that festival and the message inherent in the festival.\n11\n11. The libraries and laboratories should be modernised, updated and upgraded Regularly.\n12\n12. Use Modern and latest technology and tools in teaching.\n13\n13. There should be continuous and sustained effort to improvise and implement innovative ideas and new methods in teaching.\n14\n14. Holistic personality development of the students is one of the main goals of the educational institutions of Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad. Keeping this mission in mind and to achieve the desired goal a holistic conducive campus culture needs to be devised, developed and implemented.\n15\n15. Cleanliness is akin to worship. Educational and health institutions are basically service centres. These institutions are like places of worship, therefore they should be kept clean and hygienic, just like one's own home, house, Ashram or Temple. Moreover, the trees, plants and vegetation etc. within and around the campus are natural sources of oxygen, the most essential and vital ingredients for our life, therefore our institutions should always strive to keep and maintain a good vegetation cover to ensure greenery in and around the campus. A green and clean salubrious campus provides a healthy, invigorating and inviting ambience to work and is a very essential requirement for a good working place.\n16\n16. Our institutions engaged in providing education, training and health services are also responsible for health, hygiene, informal education and sanitation etc. of the people living in the adjoining residential areas/colonies/villages etc. of the institution in addition to organizing public awareness drives regarding various national programmes, social and community issues. Students of our institutions should play an active role in such socio-cultural-informative and educative community activities.\n17\n17. Prayer assembly (National anthem, national song, Saraswati Vandana, Prayer to almighty etc.) is the guiding and ever inspiring activity of the institutions engaged in the field of education and training. Therefore this activity should be practiced every day ritually and religiously with utmost devotion and dedication.\n18\n18. Patriotism, love, affection and pride in one's own culture, reverence for one's own society, traditions, ethics and morality should necessarily be taught as life values in our educational institutions.\n19\n19. The heads of the institution should plan and prepare during the summer vacation w.r.t. all the formal and informal activities of their institutions for the upcoming academic session. All the development and maintenance work related to infrastructure should be carried out during summer vacation only.\n20\n20. Institution heads should have a meeting with teachers and staff before the end of the academic session to review the session and get feedback positive as well as negative if any. Evaluate, analyse and see if the annual plan prepared at the start of the session has been implemented and accomplished satisfactorily and if any gap is found, identify the cause and problem areas, address them and incorporate the same in the annual plan of the following session and take appropriate action in that regard.\n21\n21. The officers and members of the institutions should accomplish something new in the following day than the day before, learn and do something new every day than the preceding day, so that institution earns something new every day than the day before."

Here within one campus, a unique one of its kind, holistic standard approach to the human health care is being established and developed — i.e., making available an advanced medical centre equipped with cutting-edge medical technologies, facilities and services (diagnosis, treatment & wellness) of almost all the pathies and disciplines of the health care viz. Yoga, Ayurveda, Allopathy, Naturopathy, Homeopathy, and Unani etc. The Vision To train, educate and groom future generation of Indianised citizens fully imbued in the ethos and values of Indian culture who are patriotic, devoted and dedicated to the cause of nation, with the motto ‘Nation First’. Keeping this motto in perspective, introducing them to the Indian culture-centric philosophy of life and making them aware of eternal Indian knowledge tradition with a mindset of dedication and devotion to serve the people. They are educated and trained in a work culture which leads them to public service in various fields of social and national life. Our aim through health and other public service-oriented projects is to ascertain our contribution in the field of public welfare, serving the people and humanity by nursing, nurturing, and conserving nature and our natural resources. We inspire and motivate others — especially those associated and active in the education and health sectors — to participate and contribute in the Yajna of social and national service. Furthermore, for us, the modern education system is a useful and helpful tool to accomplish our goal of imparting Bharat-centric education to future generations. All our institutions, including medical institutions, are in fact vehicles to achieve our well-enshrined mission of serving the people in myriad ways. The Aim Our aim is to help develop competent, responsible, and efficient citizens of tomorrow imbued in Indian value systems — which inculcate in them character, morality, courage of conviction, and the highest order of integrity — ever ready to serve the nation in any role they choose or are assigned. Moreover, to prepare skilled, forceful, and capable citizens with a syncretic view of material and spiritual life, who use acquired knowledge to empower and evolve themselves and serve the people. Preparing such citizens whose life mantra is: न त्वहम् कामये राज्यम् न स्वर्गम् न पुनर्भवम्।\nकामये दुःखतप्तानाम् प्राणिनामार्तिनाशनम्।। Translation: I do not wish for a kingdom, I do not want heaven or salvation. It is my wish to help in alleviating the suffering of people."

    "content": "Facebook\nTwitter (X)\nInstagram\nSearch\nCall Us\nChat on WhatsApp\nFind Us on Maps\nAn Abode of our Inspiration: Shri Gorakhnath Temple Shri Gorakshpeeth is a Siddhpeeth. This is a Yogapeeth. This is Tapsthali of Mahayogi Guru Shri Gorakhnath the incarnation of Lord Shiva. This Peeth provides continuity to Sadhana and Siddhi and is the highest Peeth of Nath Panth. As the representative of Mahayogi Guru Shri Gorakhnath, Gorakshpeethadheeswars provide continuity to the Nath Panth traditions, therefore this Peeth has a distinguished and important position in the Nath Panth. Though in the annals of social-religious-political history of the country the name of this Peeth is mentioned for its contribution towards religious-spiritual-social renaissance but without mentioning the vital role played by Nathpanthi Yogis and Yogeshwars in the Indian freedom movement and their participation in the Sanyasi movement, the history of the Indian freedom movement won't be complete. Even today Gorakshpeeth represents those religious-spiritual centers and Gurukulas of Sanatan Sanskriti which used to be Centers & Mentors of Bharat's socio-religious-spiritual movements. This Peeth is modem version of ancient Bharatiya Mathas, Today Gorakshpeeth alongwith being one of the most important religious & Yoga centres is also a prime centre of social mass awareness. This Peeth is center of Go-seva, Jan-seva, Education & Health services. Shri Gorakhnath temple is the highest abode of Nathpanth. Nathpanth have prominent place among various Sects/Panths which developed and evolved from time to time in Sanatan Dharma in various fields of Philosophy, Spirituality and Sadhna etc. There is hardly any state, region or district in the Bharat which is not treaded and touched by the pious feet of Nath Siddhas & Yogis. The presence of Nathpanth shrines like Temples, Mathas, Ashrams, Daleechas, Khohas, Guphas and Teelas are live evidences which distinctly prove that Nath Panth has been a glorious, revolutionary Panth spread from Kutees to Palaces far and wide across the Aryavarta. Nathpanth has been engaged in the spiritual and Yogic enlightenment of the entire humanity irrespective of caste, creed, race, region and religion. Nathpanth had been spread across and beyond the present political boundary of Bharat, in today's countries like Tibet, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and many other countries of Asia as a flag bearer of Yoga and Indian culture and have been engaged in public welfare in its own way. In post independent Bharat Shri Gorakhnath Temple/Peeth become one of the most prominent and distinguished centres of Hindu religion and philosophy. Founder of 'Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad' Yugpurush Gorakshpeethadheeswar Brahmleen Mahant Digvijainath ji Maharaj, has been witness to the immortalised Sepoy Mutiny of Chauri Chaura in the Indian freedom movement, a symbol of peoples' uprising against British government. Subsequently, Mahant Digvijainath ji Maharaj got identified and become synonymous with the Gorakhpur. With the integrated, composite view of 'Nationalism & Development and 'Spiritualism & Materialism' he showed the path of spiritual life to the Mathas & Mandirs of the country. Simultaneously he guided the suffering common people and inspired them to be dedicated and committed towards their worldly duties. Yugpurush Mahant Digvijainath ji Maharaj on the one hand made Gorakhnath temple a hub and catalyst of spiritualism based social revolution and upliftment of backwards and downtrodden and on the other hand in 1932 AD he initiated a sort of educational revolution in eastern Uttar Pradesh especially in Gorakhpur by founding Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad. Yugpurush Gorakshpeethadheeswar Brahmleen Mahant Digvijainath ji Maharaj by organising 'Akhil Bharatiya Avdhoot Bhesh Barah Panth Yogi Mahasabha' integrated, organised and defined the Socio-National role of Nathpanth Yogis scattered all over the country. In fact, this was his monumental historical work. At the same time, under the umbrella of Hindu Mahasabha, he tried to bring in Indian values and culture in the anglicised/westemnised Indian politics. Consequently, by breaking barriers of the then prevailing numerous sects and thoughts based on different spiritual and philosophical ideologies the Gorakhnath Temple become epicentre of an integrated and composite Hindu nationalism and is still continuing its role of integration of Hindu society with added impetus, fervour and glory Gorakshpeethadheeswar Brahmleen Mahant Avedyanath ji Maharaj continued this monumental work of social integration by instigating and leading the Sadhus, Saints, Mahatmas and Peethadheeswars who had been mostly and exclusively engaged in the Sadhana for their own self-salvation to join in and play active, leading and guiding role in the Socio-political field of the nation for social integration and wellbeing of the nation. Consequently, there were large number of Sadhu-Saints who joined the different political and social organisations and now are engaged and working actively, passionately, tirelessly. and contributing to the society and nation in various roles in addition to their own spiritual Sadhana. We all are witness to his incessant, ceaseless, fight against the prevalent irrelevant, inhuman traditions, superstitions, casteism and untouchability etc. which divides our society on umpteen fault lines. He associated almost all the Math-Mandirs of the country with the movement of Samajik Samrasta' which is his one of the greatest contribution towards the national infegrity and unity. His this one significant contribution of social integration and unity is one of the brightest golden chapter in the annals of history of our country. His able and brilliant fruitful leadership provided to Shri Ramjanm Bhoomi Movement is one of the brilliant efforts towards the national integrity, cultural renaissance of Bharat and re establishment of our lost forgotten Asmita and glory. Shri Ramjanm Bhoomi movement is a defining moment in the national unity, integrity, people's participation and cultural campaign. The Gorakhnath Temple has been at the forefront and centre of this historical mass movement."
